# Women's Soccer Data Analysis: 

The **goal** of this project is to analyse historical data of women's soccor and gain insights into its **spatial aspects.** 

The project will focus on the following key points: 

1)  **Religious Factors and Women's Soccer Participation:** The impact of religious factors on women's participation in soccer will be examined. This analysis aims to investiage whether there is a correlation between religion and the limited involvement of women in soccer. Additionally , it will be particularly interesting to explore countries like iran that have experienced a shift from secularism to religious influence and examine how this transforamtion has affected women's engagement in soccor matches


2)  **Socioeconomic Factors and Women's Soccer Participation:** The relationship between socioeconomic factors and women's participation in soccor will be explored. Census data, income levels , and educational attainment will be analyzed to understand how these factors affect the availability of resources , access to training programs , and participation rates in different regions or communities. 


3)  **Spatial Analysis of Women's Soccor Facilities:** The distribution and accessibility of women's soccor fields, stadiums and training facilities will be analyzed. Spatial data and geographic information systems(GIS) will be used to map these locations and assess if there are any spatial disparities in their distribution across regions or within communities.


4)  **Mapping Women's Soccer Success:** The spatial distribution of successful women's soccer teams or players will be mapped. Data on championships , national teams apperances , or individual accolades will be used to visualize the concentration or dispersion of success across different regions or countries. This Analysis can help identify potential factors contribuating to success , such as investment in infrastructure , training programs , or cultural attitudes towards womens's sports 


5)  **Spatial Patterns of Women's Soccor Talent:** Data on player origins , academies , and youth development programs will be used to explore spatial patterns of talent in women's soccor. 
    it will be analyzed how certain regions or communities produce a disproportionately high number of successful players and investigate the underlying factors contributing to these spatial patterns.
